# school-bus-dbms
This is a dynamic and flexible application of a School/College Bus Management System. I have designed a simple and efficient system that can be used by a bus transport in charge in a school or a college. This system has been designed keeping in mind the real-world entities involved in a School Bus.  
There are six entities present in this system which are Driver, Route, Bus Stop, Students and Fee.  
There are five relations present in this database. The relations have been normalized to ensure there is no redundancy.
